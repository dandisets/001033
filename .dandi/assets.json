"Subject ID: 1_2. A sine wave stimulation applied at 20Hz using 3V (peak-to-peak) amplitude. Note: this is not the actual amplitude measured on the oscilloscope, which will be somewhat smaller (calibration factors are frequency-dependent and will be reported separately after the calibration is completed). For the employed electrode configuration, 1V translates into 36 V/cm at the location of neurons. Neuron action potentials were visualized using the voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye, FluoVolt. All experiments were performed in a standard physiological solution containing (in mM): 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg). The exposure system comprised a Siglent SDG1032X waveform generator (Siglent Technologies, Solon, OH), the 'EasywaveX' software, and a pair of tungsten electrodes (100 μm diameter, 140 μm inter-electrode gap) precisely positioned 50 µm above a chosen neuron using a robotic micromanipulator MPC-200 (Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA). Sine waves and modulated sine waves were generated using Excel software, uploaded to the Siglent generator, and exposure parameters (frequency, amplitude, and duration) were set. Exposure was triggered 50 ms after the start of fluorescence time-lapse recording. The applied electric field between electrodes was determined using a finite element method simulation (Sim4Life V5.2, Zurich Med Tech). Exposure duration was kept at 250 ms regardless of the sine wave carrier and modulation frequency. Waveform, amplitude, and synchronization were monitored with a TDS3052C oscilloscope (Tektronix, Beaverton, OR). Exposures were synchronized with image acquisitions via a TTL pulse protocol using a Digidata 1440A board and Clampex v. 10.2 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).",

"Subject ID: 1_2. A sine wave stimulation applied at 20Hz using 5V (peak-to-peak) amplitude. Note: this is not the actual amplitude measured on the oscilloscope, which will be somewhat smaller (calibration factors are frequency-dependent and will be reported separately after the calibration is completed). For the employed electrode configuration, 1V translates into 36 V/cm at the location of neurons. Neuron action potentials were visualized using the voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye, FluoVolt. All experiments were performed in a standard physiological solution containing (in mM): 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg). The exposure system comprised a Siglent SDG1032X waveform generator (Siglent Technologies, Solon, OH), the 'EasywaveX' software, and a pair of tungsten electrodes (100 μm diameter, 140 μm inter-electrode gap) precisely positioned 50 µm above a chosen neuron using a robotic micromanipulator MPC-200 (Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA). Sine waves and modulated sine waves were generated using Excel software, uploaded to the Siglent generator, and exposure parameters (frequency, amplitude, and duration) were set. Exposure was triggered 50 ms after the start of fluorescence time-lapse recording. The applied electric field between electrodes was determined using a finite element method simulation (Sim4Life V5.2, Zurich Med Tech). Exposure duration was kept at 250 ms regardless of the sine wave carrier and modulation frequency. Waveform, amplitude, and synchronization were monitored with a TDS3052C oscilloscope (Tektronix, Beaverton, OR). Exposures were synchronized with image acquisitions via a TTL pulse protocol using a Digidata 1440A board and Clampex v. 10.2 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).",

"Subject ID: 10_2. A sine wave stimulation applied at 20kHz using 11V (peak-to-peak) amplitude. Note: this is not the actual amplitude measured on the oscilloscope, which will be somewhat smaller (calibration factors are frequency-dependent and will be reported separately after the calibration is completed). For the employed electrode configuration, 1V translates into 36 V/cm at the location of neurons. Neuron action potentials were visualized using the voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye, FluoVolt. All experiments were performed in a standard physiological solution containing (in mM): 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg). The exposure system comprised a Siglent SDG1032X waveform generator (Siglent Technologies, Solon, OH), the 'EasywaveX' software, and a pair of tungsten electrodes (100 μm diameter, 140 μm inter-electrode gap) precisely positioned 50 µm above a chosen neuron using a robotic micromanipulator MPC-200 (Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA). Sine waves and modulated sine waves were generated using Excel software, uploaded to the Siglent generator, and exposure parameters (frequency, amplitude, and duration) were set. Exposure was triggered 50 ms after the start of fluorescence time-lapse recording. The applied electric field between electrodes was determined using a finite element method simulation (Sim4Life V5.2, Zurich Med Tech).

"Subject ID: 10_2. A sine wave stimulation applied at 20kHz using 12V (peak-to-peak) amplitude. Note: this is not the actual amplitude measured on the oscilloscope, which will be somewhat smaller (calibration factors are frequency-dependent and will be reported separately after the calibration is completed). For the employed electrode configuration, 1V translates into 36 V/cm at the location of neurons. Neuron action potentials were visualized using the voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye, FluoVolt. All experiments were performed in a standard physiological solution containing (in mM): 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg). The exposure system comprised a Siglent SDG1032X waveform generator (Siglent Technologies, Solon, OH), the 'EasywaveX' software, and a pair of tungsten electrodes (100 μm diameter, 140 μm inter-electrode gap) precisely positioned 50 µm above a chosen neuron using a robotic micromanipulator MPC-200 (Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA). Sine waves and modulated sine waves were generated using Excel software, uploaded to the Siglent generator, and exposure parameters (frequency, amplitude, and duration) were set. Exposure was triggered 50 ms after the start of fluorescence time-lapse recording. The applied electric field between electrodes was determined using a finite element method simulation (Sim4Life V5.2, Zurich Med Tech). Exposure duration was kept at 250 ms regardless of the sine wave carrier and modulation frequency. Waveform, amplitude, and synchronization were monitored with a TDS3052C oscilloscope (Tektronix, Beaverton, OR). Exposures were synchronized with image acquisitions via a TTL pulse protocol using a Digidata 1440A board and Clampex v. 10.2 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).",

"Subject ID: 10_2. A sine wave stimulation applied at 20kHz using 16V (peak-to-peak) amplitude. Note: this is not the actual amplitude measured on the oscilloscope, which will be somewhat smaller (calibration factors are frequency-dependent and will be reported separately after the calibration is completed). For the employed electrode configuration, 1V translates into 36 V/cm at the location of neurons. Neuron action potentials were visualized using the voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye, FluoVolt. All experiments were performed in a standard physiological solution containing (in mM): 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg). The exposure system comprised a Siglent SDG1032X waveform generator (Siglent Technologies, Solon, OH), the 'EasywaveX' software, and a pair of tungsten electrodes (100 μm diameter, 140 μm inter-electrode gap) precisely positioned 50 µm above a chosen neuron using a robotic micromanipulator MPC-200 (Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA). Sine waves and modulated sine waves were generated using Excel software, uploaded to the Siglent generator, and exposure parameters (frequency, amplitude, and duration) were set. Exposure was triggered 50 ms after the start of fluorescence time-lapse recording. The applied electric field between electrodes was determined using a finite element method simulation (Sim4Life V5.2, Zurich Med Tech). Exposure duration was kept at 250 ms regardless of the sine wave carrier and modulation frequency. Waveform, amplitude, and synchronization were monitored with a TDS3052C oscilloscope (Tektronix, Beaverton, OR). Exposures were synchronized with image acquisitions via a TTL pulse protocol using a Digidata 1440A board and Clampex v. 10.2 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).",

"Subject ID: 10_2. A sine wave stimulation applied at 20kHz using 6V (peak-to-peak) amplitude. Note: this is not the actual amplitude measured on the oscilloscope, which will be somewhat smaller (calibration factors are frequency-dependent and will be reported separately after the calibration is completed). For the employed electrode configuration, 1V translates into 36 V/cm at the location of neurons. Neuron action potentials were visualized using the voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye, FluoVolt. All experiments were performed in a standard physiological solution containing (in mM): 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg). The exposure system comprised a Siglent SDG1032X waveform generator (Siglent Technologies, Solon, OH), the 'EasywaveX' software, and a pair of tungsten electrodes (100 μm diameter, 140 μm inter-electrode gap) precisely positioned 50 µm above a chosen neuron using a robotic micromanipulator MPC-200 (Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA). Sine waves and modulated sine waves were generated using Excel software, uploaded to the Siglent generator, and exposure parameters (frequency, amplitude, and duration) were set. Exposure was triggered 50 ms after the start of fluorescence time-lapse recording. The applied electric field between electrodes was determined using a finite element method simulation (Sim4Life V5.2, Zurich Med Tech). Exposure duration was kept at 250 ms regardless of the sine wave carrier and modulation frequency. Waveform, amplitude, and synchronization were monitored with a TDS3052C oscilloscope (Tektronix, Beaverton, OR). Exposures were synchronized with image acquisitions via a TTL pulse protocol using a Digidata 1440A board and Clampex v. 10.2 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).",

"Subject ID: 10_2. A spindle (sine wave modulated at 20Hz frequency) stimulation applied at 20kHz using 13.8V (peak-to-peak) amplitude. Note: this is not the actual amplitude measured on the oscilloscope, which will be somewhat smaller (calibration factors are frequency-dependent and will be reported separately after the calibration is completed). For the employed electrode configuration, 1V translates into 36 V/cm at the location of neurons. Neuron action potentials were visualized using the voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye, FluoVolt. All experiments were performed in a standard physiological solution containing (in mM): 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg). The exposure system comprised a Siglent SDG1032X waveform generator (Siglent Technologies, Solon, OH), the 'EasywaveX' software, and a pair of tungsten electrodes (100 μm diameter, 140 μm inter-electrode gap) precisely positioned 50 µm above a chosen neuron using a robotic micromanipulator MPC-200 (Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA). Sine waves and modulated sine waves were generated using Excel software, uploaded to the Siglent generator, and exposure parameters (frequency, amplitude, and duration) were set. Exposure was triggered 50 ms after the start of fluorescence time-lapse recording. The applied electric field between electrodes was determined using a finite element method simulation (Sim4Life V5.2, Zurich Med Tech). Exposure duration was kept at 250 ms regardless of the sine wave carrier and modulation frequency. Waveform, amplitude, and synchronization were monitored with a TDS3052C oscilloscope (Tektronix, Beaverton, OR). Exposures were synchronized with image acquisitions via a TTL pulse protocol using a Digidata 1440A board and Clampex v. 10.2 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).",

"Subject ID: 10_2. A spindle (sine wave modulated at 20Hz frequency) stimulation applied at 20kHz using 14.4V (peak-to-peak) amplitude. Note: this is not the actual amplitude measured on the oscilloscope, which will be somewhat smaller (calibration factors are frequency-dependent and will be reported separately after the calibration is completed). For the employed electrode configuration, 1V translates into 36 V/cm at the location of neurons. Neuron action potentials were visualized using the voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye, FluoVolt. All experiments were performed in a standard physiological solution containing (in mM): 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg). The exposure system comprised a Siglent SDG1032X waveform generator (Siglent Technologies, Solon, OH), the 'EasywaveX' software, and a pair of tungsten electrodes (100 μm diameter, 140 μm inter-electrode gap) precisely positioned 50 µm above a chosen neuron using a robotic micromanipulator MPC-200 (Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA). Sine waves and modulated sine waves were generated using Excel software, uploaded to the Siglent generator, and exposure parameters (frequency, amplitude, and duration) were set. Exposure was triggered 50 ms after the start of fluorescence time-lapse recording. The applied electric field between electrodes was determined using a finite element method simulation (Sim4Life V5.2, Zurich Med Tech). Exposure duration was kept at 250 ms regardless of the sine wave carrier and modulation frequency. Waveform, amplitude, and synchronization were monitored with a TDS3052C oscilloscope (Tektronix, Beaverton, OR).

"Subject ID: 10_2. A sine wave stimulation applied at 2kHz using 4.2V (peak-to-peak) amplitude. Note: this is not the actual amplitude measured on the oscilloscope, which will be somewhat smaller (calibration factors are frequency-dependent and will be reported separately after the calibration is completed). For the employed electrode configuration, 1V translates into 36 V/cm at the location of neurons. Neuron action potentials were visualized using the voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye, FluoVolt. All experiments were performed in a standard physiological solution containing (in mM): 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg). The exposure system comprised a Siglent SDG1032X waveform generator (Siglent Technologies, Solon, OH), the 'EasywaveX' software, and a pair of tungsten electrodes (100 μm diameter, 140 μm inter-electrode gap) precisely positioned 50 µm above a chosen neuron using a robotic micromanipulator MPC-200 (Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA). Sine waves and modulated sine waves were generated using Excel software, uploaded to the Siglent generator, and exposure parameters (frequency, amplitude, and duration) were set. Exposure was triggered 50 ms after the start of fluorescence time-lapse recording. The applied electric field between electrodes was determined using a finite element method simulation (Sim4Life V5.2, Zurich Med Tech). Exposure duration was kept at 250 ms regardless of the sine wave carrier and modulation frequency. Waveform, amplitude, and synchronization were monitored with a TDS3052C oscilloscope (Tektronix, Beaverton, OR). Exposures were synchronized with image acquisitions via a TTL pulse protocol using a Digidata 1440A board and Clampex v. 10.2 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).",

The exposure system comprised a Siglent SDG1032X waveform generator (Siglent Technologies, Solon, OH), the 'EasywaveX' software, and a pair of tungsten electrodes (100 μm diameter, 140 μm inter-electrode gap) precisely positioned 50 µm above a chosen neuron using a robotic micromanipulator MPC-200 (Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA). Sine waves and modulated sine waves were generated using Excel software, uploaded to the Siglent generator, and exposure parameters (frequency, amplitude, and duration) were set. Exposure was triggered 50 ms after the start of fluorescence time-lapse recording. The applied electric field between electrodes was determined using a finite element method simulation (Sim4Life V5.2, Zurich Med Tech). Exposure duration was kept at 250 ms regardless of the sine wave carrier and modulation frequency.

"Subject ID: 10_2. A spindle (sine wave modulated at 20Hz frequency) stimulation applied at 2kHz using 4V (peak-to-peak) amplitude.

For the employed electrode configuration, 1V translates into 36 V/cm at the location of neurons. Neuron action potentials were visualized using the voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye, FluoVolt. All experiments were performed in a standard physiological solution containing (in mM): 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg). The exposure system comprised a Siglent SDG1032X waveform generator (Siglent Technologies, Solon, OH), the 'EasywaveX' software, and a pair of tungsten electrodes (100 μm diameter, 140 μm inter-electrode gap) precisely positioned 50 µm above a chosen neuron using a robotic micromanipulator MPC-200 (Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA). Sine waves and modulated sine waves were generated using Excel software, uploaded to the Siglent generator, and exposure parameters (frequency, amplitude, and duration) were set.

"Subject ID: 2_2. A sine wave stimulation applied at 2kHz using 4.2V (peak-to-peak) amplitude. Note: this is not the actual amplitude measured on the oscilloscope, which will be somewhat smaller (calibration factors are frequency-dependent and will be reported separately after the calibration is completed). For the employed electrode configuration, 1V translates into 36 V/cm at the location of neurons. Neuron action potentials were visualized using the voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye, FluoVolt. All experiments were performed in a standard physiological solution containing (in mM): 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg). The exposure system comprised a Siglent SDG1032X waveform generator (Siglent Technologies, Solon, OH), the 'EasywaveX' software, and a pair of tungsten electrodes (100 μm diameter, 140 μm inter-electrode gap) precisely positioned 50 µm above a chosen neuron using a robotic micromanipulator MPC-200 (Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA). Sine waves and modulated sine waves were generated using Excel software, uploaded to the Siglent generator, and exposure parameters (frequency, amplitude, and duration) were set. Exposure was triggered 50 ms after the start of fluorescence time-lapse recording. The applied electric field between electrodes was determined using a finite element method simulation (Sim4Life V5.2, Zurich Med Tech). Exposure duration was kept at 250 ms regardless of the sine wave carrier and modulation frequency. Waveform, amplitude, and synchronization were monitored with a TDS3052C oscilloscope (Tektronix, Beaverton, OR).

"Subject ID: 2_2. A sine wave stimulation applied at 2kHz using 4.8V (peak-to-peak) amplitude. Note: this is not the actual amplitude measured on the oscilloscope, which will be somewhat smaller (calibration factors are frequency-dependent and will be reported separately after the calibration is completed). For the employed electrode configuration, 1V translates into 36 V/cm at the location of neurons. Neuron action potentials were visualized using the voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye, FluoVolt. All experiments were performed in a standard physiological solution containing (in mM): 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg). The exposure system comprised a Siglent SDG1032X waveform generator (Siglent Technologies, Solon, OH), the 'EasywaveX' software, and a pair of tungsten electrodes (100 μm diameter, 140 μm inter-electrode gap) precisely positioned 50 µm above a chosen neuron using a robotic micromanipulator MPC-200 (Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA). Sine waves and modulated sine waves were generated using Excel software, uploaded to the Siglent generator, and exposure parameters (frequency, amplitude, and duration) were set. Exposure was triggered 50 ms after the start of fluorescence time-lapse recording. The applied electric field between electrodes was determined using a finite element method simulation (Sim4Life V5.2, Zurich Med Tech). Exposure duration was kept at 250 ms regardless of the sine wave carrier and modulation frequency. Waveform, amplitude, and synchronization were monitored with a TDS3052C oscilloscope (Tektronix, Beaverton, OR). Exposures were synchronized with image acquisitions via a TTL pulse protocol using a Digidata 1440A board and Clampex v. 10.2 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).",

"Subject ID: 2_2. A spindle (sine wave modulated at 20Hz frequency) stimulation applied at 2kHz using 4.2V (peak-to-peak) amplitude. Note: this is not the actual amplitude measured on the oscilloscope, which will be somewhat smaller (calibration factors are frequency-dependent and will be reported separately after the calibration is completed). For the employed electrode configuration, 1V translates into 36 V/cm at the location of neurons. Neuron action potentials were visualized using the voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye, FluoVolt. All experiments were performed in a standard physiological solution containing (in mM): 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg). The exposure system comprised a Siglent SDG1032X waveform generator (Siglent Technologies, Solon, OH), the 'EasywaveX' software, and a pair of tungsten electrodes (100 μm diameter, 140 μm inter-electrode gap) precisely positioned 50 µm above a chosen neuron using a robotic micromanipulator MPC-200 (Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA). Sine waves and modulated sine waves were generated using Excel software, uploaded to the Siglent generator, and exposure parameters (frequency, amplitude, and duration) were set. Exposure was triggered 50 ms after the start of fluorescence time-lapse recording. The applied electric field between electrodes was determined using a finite element method simulation (Sim4Life V5.2, Zurich Med Tech). Exposure duration was kept at 250 ms regardless of the sine wave carrier and modulation frequency. Waveform, amplitude, and synchronization were monitored with a TDS3052C oscilloscope (Tektronix, Beaverton, OR). Exposures were synchronized with image acquisitions via a TTL pulse protocol using a Digidata 1440A board and Clampex v. 10.2 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).",

"Subject ID: 2_2. A spindle (sine wave modulated at 20Hz frequency) stimulation applied at 2kHz using 5V (peak-to-peak) amplitude. Note: this is not the actual amplitude measured on the oscilloscope, which will be somewhat smaller (calibration factors are frequency-dependent and will be reported separately after the calibration is completed). For the employed electrode configuration, 1V translates into 36 V/cm at the location of neurons. Neuron action potentials were visualized using the voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye, FluoVolt. All experiments were performed in a standard physiological solution containing (in mM): 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg). The exposure system comprised a Siglent SDG1032X waveform generator (Siglent Technologies, Solon, OH), the 'EasywaveX' software, and a pair of tungsten electrodes (100 μm diameter, 140 μm inter-electrode gap) precisely positioned 50 µm above a chosen neuron using a robotic micromanipulator MPC-200 (Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA). Sine waves and modulated sine waves were generated using Excel software, uploaded to the Siglent generator, and exposure parameters (frequency, amplitude, and duration) were set. Exposure was triggered 50 ms after the start of fluorescence time-lapse recording. The applied electric field between electrodes was determined using a finite element method simulation (Sim4Life V5.2, Zurich Med Tech). Exposure duration was kept at 250 ms regardless of the sine wave carrier and modulation frequency. Waveform, amplitude, and synchronization were monitored with a TDS3052C oscilloscope (Tektronix, Beaverton, OR). Exposures were synchronized with image acquisitions via a TTL pulse protocol using a Digidata 1440A board and Clampex v. 10.2 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).",

The exposure system comprised a Siglent SDG1032X waveform generator (Siglent Technologies, Solon, OH), the 'EasywaveX' software, and a pair of tungsten electrodes (100 μm diameter, 140 μm inter-electrode gap) precisely positioned 50 µm above a chosen neuron using a robotic micromanipulator MPC-200 (Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA). Sine waves and modulated sine waves were generated using Excel software, uploaded to the Siglent generator, and exposure parameters (frequency, amplitude, and duration) were set. Exposure was triggered 50 ms after the start of fluorescence time-lapse recording. The applied electric field between electrodes was determined using a finite element method simulation (Sim4Life V5.2, Zurich Med Tech). Exposure duration was kept at 250 ms regardless of the sine wave carrier and modulation frequency. Waveform, amplitude, and synchronization were monitored with a TDS3052C oscilloscope (Tektronix, Beaverton, OR). Exposures were synchronized with image acquisitions via a TTL pulse protocol using a Digidata 1440A board and Clampex v. 10.2 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).",

"Subject ID: 3_2. A sine wave stimulation applied at 2kHz using 4.8V (peak-to-peak) amplitude. Note: this is not the actual amplitude measured on the oscilloscope, which will be somewhat smaller (calibration factors are frequency-dependent and will be reported separately after the calibration is completed). For the employed electrode configuration, 1V translates into 36 V/cm at the location of neurons. Neuron action potentials were visualized using the voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye, FluoVolt. All experiments were performed in a standard physiological solution containing (in mM): 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg). The exposure system comprised a Siglent SDG1032X waveform generator (Siglent Technologies, Solon, OH), the 'EasywaveX' software, and a pair of tungsten electrodes (100 μm diameter, 140 μm inter-electrode gap) precisely positioned 50 µm above a chosen neuron using a robotic micromanipulator MPC-200 (Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA). Sine waves and modulated sine waves were generated using Excel software, uploaded to the Siglent generator, and exposure parameters (frequency, amplitude, and duration) were set. Exposure was triggered 50 ms after the start of fluorescence time-lapse recording. The applied electric field between electrodes was determined using a finite element method simulation (Sim4Life V5.2, Zurich Med Tech). Exposure duration was kept at 250 ms regardless of the sine wave carrier and modulation frequency.

"Subject ID: 3_2. A sine wave stimulation applied at 2kHz using 5.8V (peak-to-peak) amplitude. Note: this is not the actual amplitude measured on the oscilloscope, which will be somewhat smaller (calibration factors are frequency-dependent and will be reported separately after the calibration is completed). For the employed electrode configuration, 1V translates into 36 V/cm at the location of neurons. Neuron action potentials were visualized using the voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye, FluoVolt. All experiments were performed in a standard physiological solution containing (in mM): 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg). The exposure system comprised a Siglent SDG1032X waveform generator (Siglent Technologies, Solon, OH), the 'EasywaveX' software, and a pair of tungsten electrodes (100 μm diameter, 140 μm inter-electrode gap) precisely positioned 50 µm above a chosen neuron using a robotic micromanipulator MPC-200 (Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA). Sine waves and modulated sine waves were generated using Excel software, uploaded to the Siglent generator, and exposure parameters (frequency, amplitude, and duration) were set. Exposure was triggered 50 ms after the start of fluorescence time-lapse recording. The applied electric field between electrodes was determined using a finite element method simulation (Sim4Life V5.2, Zurich Med Tech). Exposure duration was kept at 250 ms regardless of the sine wave carrier and modulation frequency. Waveform, amplitude, and synchronization were monitored with a TDS3052C oscilloscope (Tektronix, Beaverton, OR). Exposures were synchronized with image acquisitions via a TTL pulse protocol using a Digidata 1440A board and Clampex v. 10.2 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).",

"Subject ID: 3_2. A sine wave stimulation applied at 2kHz using 7V (peak-to-peak) amplitude. Note: this is not the actual amplitude measured on the oscilloscope, which will be somewhat smaller (calibration factors are frequency-dependent and will be reported separately after the calibration is completed). For the employed electrode configuration, 1V translates into 36 V/cm at the location of neurons. Neuron action potentials were visualized using the voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye, FluoVolt. All experiments were performed in a standard physiological solution containing (in mM): 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg). The exposure system comprised a Siglent SDG1032X waveform generator (Siglent Technologies, Solon, OH), the 'EasywaveX' software, and a pair of tungsten electrodes (100 μm diameter, 140 μm inter-electrode gap) precisely positioned 50 µm above a chosen neuron using a robotic micromanipulator MPC-200 (Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA). Sine waves and modulated sine waves were generated using Excel software, uploaded to the Siglent generator, and exposure parameters (frequency, amplitude, and duration) were set. Exposure was triggered 50 ms after the start of fluorescence time-lapse recording. The applied electric field between electrodes was determined using a finite element method simulation (Sim4Life V5.2, Zurich Med Tech). Exposure duration was kept at 250 ms regardless of the sine wave carrier and modulation frequency. Waveform, amplitude, and synchronization were monitored with a TDS3052C oscilloscope (Tektronix, Beaverton, OR). Exposures were synchronized with image acquisitions via a TTL pulse protocol using a Digidata 1440A board and Clampex v. 10.2 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).",

"Subject ID: 3_2. A spindle (sine wave modulated at 20Hz frequency) stimulation applied at 2kHz using 4.2V (peak-to-peak) amplitude. Note: this is not the actual amplitude measured on the oscilloscope, which will be somewhat smaller (calibration factors are frequency-dependent and will be reported separately after the calibration is completed). For the employed electrode configuration, 1V translates into 36 V/cm at the location of neurons. Neuron action potentials were visualized using the voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye, FluoVolt. All experiments were performed in a standard physiological solution containing (in mM): 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg). The exposure system comprised a Siglent SDG1032X waveform generator (Siglent Technologies, Solon, OH), the 'EasywaveX' software, and a pair of tungsten electrodes (100 μm diameter, 140 μm inter-electrode gap) precisely positioned 50 µm above a chosen neuron using a robotic micromanipulator MPC-200 (Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA). Sine waves and modulated sine waves were generated using Excel software, uploaded to the Siglent generator, and exposure parameters (frequency, amplitude, and duration) were set. Exposure was triggered 50 ms after the start of fluorescence time-lapse recording. The applied electric field between electrodes was determined using a finite element method simulation (Sim4Life V5.2, Zurich Med Tech). Exposure duration was kept at 250 ms regardless of the sine wave carrier and modulation frequency. Waveform, amplitude, and synchronization were monitored with a TDS3052C oscilloscope (Tektronix, Beaverton, OR). Exposures were synchronized with image acquisitions via a TTL pulse protocol using a Digidata 1440A board and Clampex v. 10.2 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).",

"Subject ID: 4_2. A sine wave stimulation applied at 20Hz using 4.5V (peak-to-peak) amplitude. Note: this is not the actual amplitude measured on the oscilloscope, which will be somewhat smaller (calibration factors are frequency-dependent and will be reported separately after the calibration is completed). For the employed electrode configuration, 1V translates into 36 V/cm at the location of neurons. Neuron action potentials were visualized using the voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye, FluoVolt. All experiments were performed in a standard physiological solution containing (in mM): 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg). The exposure system comprised a Siglent SDG1032X waveform generator (Siglent Technologies, Solon, OH), the 'EasywaveX' software, and a pair of tungsten electrodes (100 μm diameter, 140 μm inter-electrode gap) precisely positioned 50 µm above a chosen neuron using a robotic micromanipulator MPC-200 (Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA). Sine waves and modulated sine waves were generated using Excel software, uploaded to the Siglent generator, and exposure parameters (frequency, amplitude, and duration) were set. Exposure was triggered 50 ms after the start of fluorescence time-lapse recording. The applied electric field between electrodes was determined using a finite element method simulation (Sim4Life V5.2, Zurich Med Tech). Exposure duration was kept at 250 ms regardless of the sine wave carrier and modulation frequency. Waveform, amplitude, and synchronization were monitored with a TDS3052C oscilloscope (Tektronix, Beaverton, OR). Exposures were synchronized with image acquisitions via a TTL pulse protocol using a Digidata 1440A board and Clampex v. 10.2 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).",

Sine waves and modulated sine waves were generated using Excel software, uploaded to the Siglent generator, and exposure parameters (frequency, amplitude, and duration) were set. Exposure was triggered 50 ms after the start of fluorescence time-lapse recording. The applied electric field between electrodes was determined using a finite element method simulation (Sim4Life V5.2, Zurich Med Tech). Exposure duration was kept at 250 ms regardless of the sine wave carrier and modulation frequency. Waveform, amplitude, and synchronization were monitored with a TDS3052C oscilloscope (Tektronix, Beaverton, OR).

"Subject ID: 4_2. A sine wave stimulation applied at 500Hz using 5.6V (peak-to-peak) amplitude. Note: this is not the actual amplitude measured on the oscilloscope, which will be somewhat smaller (calibration factors are frequency-dependent and will be reported separately after the calibration is completed). For the employed electrode configuration, 1V translates into 36 V/cm at the location of neurons. Neuron action potentials were visualized using the voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye, FluoVolt.

"Subject ID: 4_2. A sine wave stimulation applied at 50Hz using 5.4V (peak-to-peak) amplitude. Note: this is not the actual amplitude measured on the oscilloscope, which will be somewhat smaller (calibration factors are frequency-dependent and will be reported separately after the calibration is completed). For the employed electrode configuration, 1V translates into 36 V/cm at the location of neurons. Neuron action potentials were visualized using the voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye, FluoVolt. All experiments were performed in a standard physiological solution containing (in mM): 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg). The exposure system comprised a Siglent SDG1032X waveform generator (Siglent Technologies, Solon, OH), the 'EasywaveX' software, and a pair of tungsten electrodes (100 μm diameter, 140 μm inter-electrode gap) precisely positioned 50 µm above a chosen neuron using a robotic micromanipulator MPC-200 (Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA). Sine waves and modulated sine waves were generated using Excel software, uploaded to the Siglent generator, and exposure parameters (frequency, amplitude, and duration) were set. Exposure was triggered 50 ms after the start of fluorescence time-lapse recording.

"Subject ID: 5_2. A sine wave stimulation applied at 20Hz using 4.2V (peak-to-peak) amplitude. Note: this is not the actual amplitude measured on the oscilloscope, which will be somewhat smaller (calibration factors are frequency-dependent and will be reported separately after the calibration is completed). For the employed electrode configuration, 1V translates into 36 V/cm at the location of neurons. Neuron action potentials were visualized using the voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye, FluoVolt. All experiments were performed in a standard physiological solution containing (in mM): 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg). The exposure system comprised a Siglent SDG1032X waveform generator (Siglent Technologies, Solon, OH), the 'EasywaveX' software, and a pair of tungsten electrodes (100 μm diameter, 140 μm inter-electrode gap) precisely positioned 50 µm above a chosen neuron using a robotic micromanipulator MPC-200 (Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA). Sine waves and modulated sine waves were generated using Excel software, uploaded to the Siglent generator, and exposure parameters (frequency, amplitude, and duration) were set. Exposure was triggered 50 ms after the start of fluorescence time-lapse recording. The applied electric field between electrodes was determined using a finite element method simulation (Sim4Life V5.2, Zurich Med Tech). Exposure duration was kept at 250 ms regardless of the sine wave carrier and modulation frequency. Waveform, amplitude, and synchronization were monitored with a TDS3052C oscilloscope (Tektronix, Beaverton, OR). Exposures were synchronized with image acquisitions via a TTL pulse protocol using a Digidata 1440A board and Clampex v. 10.2 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).",

"Subject ID: 5_2. A sine wave stimulation applied at 20Hz using 4V (peak-to-peak) amplitude. Note: this is not the actual amplitude measured on the oscilloscope, which will be somewhat smaller (calibration factors are frequency-dependent and will be reported separately after the calibration is completed). For the employed electrode configuration, 1V translates into 36 V/cm at the location of neurons. Neuron action potentials were visualized using the voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye, FluoVolt. All experiments were performed in a standard physiological solution containing (in mM): 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg). The exposure system comprised a Siglent SDG1032X waveform generator (Siglent Technologies, Solon, OH), the 'EasywaveX' software, and a pair of tungsten electrodes (100 μm diameter, 140 μm inter-electrode gap) precisely positioned 50 µm above a chosen neuron using a robotic micromanipulator MPC-200 (Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA). Sine waves and modulated sine waves were generated using Excel software, uploaded to the Siglent generator, and exposure parameters (frequency, amplitude, and duration) were set. Exposure was triggered 50 ms after the start of fluorescence time-lapse recording. The applied electric field between electrodes was determined using a finite element method simulation (Sim4Life V5.2, Zurich Med Tech). Exposure duration was kept at 250 ms regardless of the sine wave carrier and modulation frequency. Waveform, amplitude, and synchronization were monitored with a TDS3052C oscilloscope (Tektronix, Beaverton, OR).

"Subject ID: 5_2. A sine wave stimulation applied at 40kHz using 4.6V (peak-to-peak) amplitude. Note: this is not the actual amplitude measured on the oscilloscope, which will be somewhat smaller (calibration factors are frequency-dependent and will be reported separately after the calibration is completed). For the employed electrode configuration, 1V translates into 36 V/cm at the location of neurons. Neuron action potentials were visualized using the voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye, FluoVolt. All experiments were performed in a standard physiological solution containing (in mM): 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg). The exposure system comprised a Siglent SDG1032X waveform generator (Siglent Technologies, Solon, OH), the 'EasywaveX' software, and a pair of tungsten electrodes (100 μm diameter, 140 μm inter-electrode gap) precisely positioned 50 µm above a chosen neuron using a robotic micromanipulator MPC-200 (Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA). Sine waves and modulated sine waves were generated using Excel software, uploaded to the Siglent generator, and exposure parameters (frequency, amplitude, and duration) were set. Exposure was triggered 50 ms after the start of fluorescence time-lapse recording. The applied electric field between electrodes was determined using a finite element method simulation (Sim4Life V5.2, Zurich Med Tech). Exposure duration was kept at 250 ms regardless of the sine wave carrier and modulation frequency. Waveform, amplitude, and synchronization were monitored with a TDS3052C oscilloscope (Tektronix, Beaverton, OR). Exposures were synchronized with image acquisitions via a TTL pulse protocol using a Digidata 1440A board and Clampex v. 10.2 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).",

"Subject ID: 6_2. A sine wave stimulation applied at 20kHz using 12.5V (peak-to-peak) amplitude. Note: this is not the actual amplitude measured on the oscilloscope, which will be somewhat smaller (calibration factors are frequency-dependent and will be reported separately after the calibration is completed). For the employed electrode configuration, 1V translates into 36 V/cm at the location of neurons. Neuron action potentials were visualized using the voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye, FluoVolt. All experiments were performed in a standard physiological solution containing (in mM): 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg). The exposure system comprised a Siglent SDG1032X waveform generator (Siglent Technologies, Solon, OH), the 'EasywaveX' software, and a pair of tungsten electrodes (100 μm diameter, 140 μm inter-electrode gap) precisely positioned 50 µm above a chosen neuron using a robotic micromanipulator MPC-200 (Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA). Sine waves and modulated sine waves were generated using Excel software, uploaded to the Siglent generator, and exposure parameters (frequency, amplitude, and duration) were set. Exposure was triggered 50 ms after the start of fluorescence time-lapse recording. The applied electric field between electrodes was determined using a finite element method simulation (Sim4Life V5.2, Zurich Med Tech). Exposure duration was kept at 250 ms regardless of the sine wave carrier and modulation frequency. Waveform, amplitude, and synchronization were monitored with a TDS3052C oscilloscope (Tektronix, Beaverton, OR). Exposures were synchronized with image acquisitions via a TTL pulse protocol using a Digidata 1440A board and Clampex v. 10.2 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).",

Exposure was triggered 50 ms after the start of fluorescence time-lapse recording. The applied electric field between electrodes was determined using a finite element method simulation (Sim4Life V5.2, Zurich Med Tech). Exposure duration was kept at 250 ms regardless of the sine wave carrier and modulation frequency. Waveform, amplitude, and synchronization were monitored with a TDS3052C oscilloscope (Tektronix, Beaverton, OR). Exposures were synchronized with image acquisitions via a TTL pulse protocol using a Digidata 1440A board and Clampex v. 10.2 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).",

"Subject ID: 6_2. A sine wave stimulation applied at 20kHz using 15V (peak-to-peak) amplitude. Note: this is not the actual amplitude measured on the oscilloscope, which will be somewhat smaller (calibration factors are frequency-dependent and will be reported separately after the calibration is completed). For the employed electrode configuration, 1V translates into 36 V/cm at the location of neurons. Neuron action potentials were visualized using the voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye, FluoVolt. All experiments were performed in a standard physiological solution containing (in mM): 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg).

"Subject ID: 6_2. A sine wave stimulation applied at 20kHz using 18V (peak-to-peak) amplitude. Note: this is not the actual amplitude measured on the oscilloscope, which will be somewhat smaller (calibration factors are frequency-dependent and will be reported separately after the calibration is completed). For the employed electrode configuration, 1V translates into 36 V/cm at the location of neurons. Neuron action potentials were visualized using the voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye, FluoVolt. All experiments were performed in a standard physiological solution containing (in mM): 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg). The exposure system comprised a Siglent SDG1032X waveform generator (Siglent Technologies, Solon, OH), the 'EasywaveX' software, and a pair of tungsten electrodes (100 μm diameter, 140 μm inter-electrode gap) precisely positioned 50 µm above a chosen neuron using a robotic micromanipulator MPC-200 (Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA). Sine waves and modulated sine waves were generated using Excel software, uploaded to the Siglent generator, and exposure parameters (frequency, amplitude, and duration) were set. Exposure was triggered 50 ms after the start of fluorescence time-lapse recording. The applied electric field between electrodes was determined using a finite element method simulation (Sim4Life V5.2, Zurich Med Tech). Exposure duration was kept at 250 ms regardless of the sine wave carrier and modulation frequency. Waveform, amplitude, and synchronization were monitored with a TDS3052C oscilloscope (Tektronix, Beaverton, OR). Exposures were synchronized with image acquisitions via a TTL pulse protocol using a Digidata 1440A board and Clampex v. 10.2 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).",

"Subject ID: 6_2. A sine wave stimulation applied at 20kHz using 6V (peak-to-peak) amplitude. Note: this is not the actual amplitude measured on the oscilloscope, which will be somewhat smaller (calibration factors are frequency-dependent and will be reported separately after the calibration is completed). For the employed electrode configuration, 1V translates into 36 V/cm at the location of neurons. Neuron action potentials were visualized using the voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye, FluoVolt. All experiments were performed in a standard physiological solution containing (in mM): 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg). The exposure system comprised a Siglent SDG1032X waveform generator (Siglent Technologies, Solon, OH), the 'EasywaveX' software, and a pair of tungsten electrodes (100 μm diameter, 140 μm inter-electrode gap) precisely positioned 50 µm above a chosen neuron using a robotic micromanipulator MPC-200 (Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA). Sine waves and modulated sine waves were generated using Excel software, uploaded to the Siglent generator, and exposure parameters (frequency, amplitude, and duration) were set. Exposure was triggered 50 ms after the start of fluorescence time-lapse recording. The applied electric field between electrodes was determined using a finite element method simulation (Sim4Life V5.2, Zurich Med Tech). Exposure duration was kept at 250 ms regardless of the sine wave carrier and modulation frequency. Waveform, amplitude, and synchronization were monitored with a TDS3052C oscilloscope (Tektronix, Beaverton, OR). Exposures were synchronized with image acquisitions via a TTL pulse protocol using a Digidata 1440A board and Clampex v. 10.2 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).",

"Subject ID: 6_2. A sine wave stimulation applied at 20kHz using 9V (peak-to-peak) amplitude. Note: this is not the actual amplitude measured on the oscilloscope, which will be somewhat smaller (calibration factors are frequency-dependent and will be reported separately after the calibration is completed). For the employed electrode configuration, 1V translates into 36 V/cm at the location of neurons. Neuron action potentials were visualized using the voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye, FluoVolt. All experiments were performed in a standard physiological solution containing (in mM): 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg). The exposure system comprised a Siglent SDG1032X waveform generator (Siglent Technologies, Solon, OH), the 'EasywaveX' software, and a pair of tungsten electrodes (100 μm diameter, 140 μm inter-electrode gap) precisely positioned 50 µm above a chosen neuron using a robotic micromanipulator MPC-200 (Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA). Sine waves and modulated sine waves were generated using Excel software, uploaded to the Siglent generator, and exposure parameters (frequency, amplitude, and duration) were set. Exposure was triggered 50 ms after the start of fluorescence time-lapse recording. The applied electric field between electrodes was determined using a finite element method simulation (Sim4Life V5.2, Zurich Med Tech). Exposure duration was kept at 250 ms regardless of the sine wave carrier and modulation frequency. Waveform, amplitude, and synchronization were monitored with a TDS3052C oscilloscope (Tektronix, Beaverton, OR).

"Subject ID: 6_2. A sine wave stimulation applied at 2kHz using 6.5V (peak-to-peak) amplitude. Note: this is not the actual amplitude measured on the oscilloscope, which will be somewhat smaller (calibration factors are frequency-dependent and will be reported separately after the calibration is completed). For the employed electrode configuration, 1V translates into 36 V/cm at the location of neurons. Neuron action potentials were visualized using the voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye, FluoVolt. All experiments were performed in a standard physiological solution containing (in mM): 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg). The exposure system comprised a Siglent SDG1032X waveform generator (Siglent Technologies, Solon, OH), the 'EasywaveX' software, and a pair of tungsten electrodes (100 μm diameter, 140 μm inter-electrode gap) precisely positioned 50 µm above a chosen neuron using a robotic micromanipulator MPC-200 (Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA). Sine waves and modulated sine waves were generated using Excel software, uploaded to the Siglent generator, and exposure parameters (frequency, amplitude, and duration) were set. Exposure was triggered 50 ms after the start of fluorescence time-lapse recording. The applied electric field between electrodes was determined using a finite element method simulation (Sim4Life V5.2, Zurich Med Tech). Exposure duration was kept at 250 ms regardless of the sine wave carrier and modulation frequency. Waveform, amplitude, and synchronization were monitored with a TDS3052C oscilloscope (Tektronix, Beaverton, OR). Exposures were synchronized with image acquisitions via a TTL pulse protocol using a Digidata 1440A board and Clampex v. 10.2 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).",

The exposure system comprised a Siglent SDG1032X waveform generator (Siglent Technologies, Solon, OH), the 'EasywaveX' software, and a pair of tungsten electrodes (100 μm diameter, 140 μm inter-electrode gap) precisely positioned 50 µm above a chosen neuron using a robotic micromanipulator MPC-200 (Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA). Sine waves and modulated sine waves were generated using Excel software, uploaded to the Siglent generator, and exposure parameters (frequency, amplitude, and duration) were set. Exposure was triggered 50 ms after the start of fluorescence time-lapse recording. The applied electric field between electrodes was determined using a finite element method simulation (Sim4Life V5.2, Zurich Med Tech).

"Subject ID: 6_2. A spindle (sine wave modulated at 20Hz frequency) stimulation applied at 2kHz using 8V (peak-to-peak) amplitude. Note: this is not the actual amplitude measured on the oscilloscope, which will be somewhat smaller (calibration factors are frequency-dependent and will be reported separately after the calibration is completed). For the employed electrode configuration, 1V translates into 36 V/cm at the location of neurons. Neuron action potentials were visualized using the voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye, FluoVolt. All experiments were performed in a standard physiological solution containing (in mM): 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg). The exposure system comprised a Siglent SDG1032X waveform generator (Siglent Technologies, Solon, OH), the 'EasywaveX' software, and a pair of tungsten electrodes (100 μm diameter, 140 μm inter-electrode gap) precisely positioned 50 µm above a chosen neuron using a robotic micromanipulator MPC-200 (Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA). Sine waves and modulated sine waves were generated using Excel software, uploaded to the Siglent generator, and exposure parameters (frequency, amplitude, and duration) were set. Exposure was triggered 50 ms after the start of fluorescence time-lapse recording. The applied electric field between electrodes was determined using a finite element method simulation (Sim4Life V5.2, Zurich Med Tech). Exposure duration was kept at 250 ms regardless of the sine wave carrier and modulation frequency. Waveform, amplitude, and synchronization were monitored with a TDS3052C oscilloscope (Tektronix, Beaverton, OR). Exposures were synchronized with image acquisitions via a TTL pulse protocol using a Digidata 1440A board and Clampex v. 10.2 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).",

"Subject ID: 7_2. A sine wave stimulation applied at 20Hz using 5.2V (peak-to-peak) amplitude. Note: this is not the actual amplitude measured on the oscilloscope, which will be somewhat smaller (calibration factors are frequency-dependent and will be reported separately after the calibration is completed). For the employed electrode configuration, 1V translates into 36 V/cm at the location of neurons. Neuron action potentials were visualized using the voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye, FluoVolt. All experiments were performed in a standard physiological solution containing (in mM): 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg). The exposure system comprised a Siglent SDG1032X waveform generator (Siglent Technologies, Solon, OH), the 'EasywaveX' software, and a pair of tungsten electrodes (100 μm diameter, 140 μm inter-electrode gap) precisely positioned 50 µm above a chosen neuron using a robotic micromanipulator MPC-200 (Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA). Sine waves and modulated sine waves were generated using Excel software, uploaded to the Siglent generator, and exposure parameters (frequency, amplitude, and duration) were set. Exposure was triggered 50 ms after the start of fluorescence time-lapse recording. The applied electric field between electrodes was determined using a finite element method simulation (Sim4Life V5.2, Zurich Med Tech). Exposure duration was kept at 250 ms regardless of the sine wave carrier and modulation frequency. Waveform, amplitude, and synchronization were monitored with a TDS3052C oscilloscope (Tektronix, Beaverton, OR). Exposures were synchronized with image acquisitions via a TTL pulse protocol using a Digidata 1440A board and Clampex v. 10.2 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).",

"Subject ID: 7_2. A sine wave stimulation applied at 20kHz using 16V (peak-to-peak) amplitude. Note: this is not the actual amplitude measured on the oscilloscope, which will be somewhat smaller (calibration factors are frequency-dependent and will be reported separately after the calibration is completed). For the employed electrode configuration, 1V translates into 36 V/cm at the location of neurons. Neuron action potentials were visualized using the voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye, FluoVolt. All experiments were performed in a standard physiological solution containing (in mM): 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg). The exposure system comprised a Siglent SDG1032X waveform generator (Siglent Technologies, Solon, OH), the 'EasywaveX' software, and a pair of tungsten electrodes (100 μm diameter, 140 μm inter-electrode gap) precisely positioned 50 µm above a chosen neuron using a robotic micromanipulator MPC-200 (Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA). Sine waves and modulated sine waves were generated using Excel software, uploaded to the Siglent generator, and exposure parameters (frequency, amplitude, and duration) were set. Exposure was triggered 50 ms after the start of fluorescence time-lapse recording. The applied electric field between electrodes was determined using a finite element method simulation (Sim4Life V5.2, Zurich Med Tech). Exposure duration was kept at 250 ms regardless of the sine wave carrier and modulation frequency. Waveform, amplitude, and synchronization were monitored with a TDS3052C oscilloscope (Tektronix, Beaverton, OR). Exposures were synchronized with image acquisitions via a TTL pulse protocol using a Digidata 1440A board and Clampex v. 10.2 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).",

"Subject ID: 7_2. A sine wave stimulation applied at 20kHz using 8V (peak-to-peak) amplitude. Note: this is not the actual amplitude measured on the oscilloscope, which will be somewhat smaller (calibration factors are frequency-dependent and will be reported separately after the calibration is completed). For the employed electrode configuration, 1V translates into 36 V/cm at the location of neurons. Neuron action potentials were visualized using the voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye, FluoVolt. All experiments were performed in a standard physiological solution containing (in mM): 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg). The exposure system comprised a Siglent SDG1032X waveform generator (Siglent Technologies, Solon, OH), the 'EasywaveX' software, and a pair of tungsten electrodes (100 μm diameter, 140 μm inter-electrode gap) precisely positioned 50 µm above a chosen neuron using a robotic micromanipulator MPC-200 (Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA). Sine waves and modulated sine waves were generated using Excel software, uploaded to the Siglent generator, and exposure parameters (frequency, amplitude, and duration) were set. Exposure was triggered 50 ms after the start of fluorescence time-lapse recording. The applied electric field between electrodes was determined using a finite element method simulation (Sim4Life V5.2, Zurich Med Tech). Exposure duration was kept at 250 ms regardless of the sine wave carrier and modulation frequency.

"Subject ID: 7_2. A sine wave stimulation applied at 2kHz using 4.8V (peak-to-peak) amplitude. Note: this is not the actual amplitude measured on the oscilloscope, which will be somewhat smaller (calibration factors are frequency-dependent and will be reported separately after the calibration is completed). For the employed electrode configuration, 1V translates into 36 V/cm at the location of neurons. Neuron action potentials were visualized using the voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye, FluoVolt. All experiments were performed in a standard physiological solution containing (in mM): 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg). The exposure system comprised a Siglent SDG1032X waveform generator (Siglent Technologies, Solon, OH), the 'EasywaveX' software, and a pair of tungsten electrodes (100 μm diameter, 140 μm inter-electrode gap) precisely positioned 50 µm above a chosen neuron using a robotic micromanipulator MPC-200 (Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA). Sine waves and modulated sine waves were generated using Excel software, uploaded to the Siglent generator, and exposure parameters (frequency, amplitude, and duration) were set. Exposure was triggered 50 ms after the start of fluorescence time-lapse recording. The applied electric field between electrodes was determined using a finite element method simulation (Sim4Life V5.2, Zurich Med Tech). Exposure duration was kept at 250 ms regardless of the sine wave carrier and modulation frequency. Waveform, amplitude, and synchronization were monitored with a TDS3052C oscilloscope (Tektronix, Beaverton, OR). Exposures were synchronized with image acquisitions via a TTL pulse protocol using a Digidata 1440A board and Clampex v. 10.2 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).",

The exposure system comprised a Siglent SDG1032X waveform generator (Siglent Technologies, Solon, OH), the 'EasywaveX' software, and a pair of tungsten electrodes (100 μm diameter, 140 μm inter-electrode gap) precisely positioned 50 µm above a chosen neuron using a robotic micromanipulator MPC-200 (Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA). Sine waves and modulated sine waves were generated using Excel software, uploaded to the Siglent generator, and exposure parameters (frequency, amplitude, and duration) were set. Exposure was triggered 50 ms after the start of fluorescence time-lapse recording. The applied electric field between electrodes was determined using a finite element method simulation (Sim4Life V5.2, Zurich Med Tech). Exposure duration was kept at 250 ms regardless of the sine wave carrier and modulation frequency. Waveform, amplitude, and synchronization were monitored with a TDS3052C oscilloscope (Tektronix, Beaverton, OR). Exposures were synchronized with image acquisitions via a TTL pulse protocol using a Digidata 1440A board and Clampex v. 10.2 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).",

"Subject ID: 8_2. A sine wave stimulation applied at 2kHz using 10V (peak-to-peak) amplitude. Note: this is not the actual amplitude measured on the oscilloscope, which will be somewhat smaller (calibration factors are frequency-dependent and will be reported separately after the calibration is completed). For the employed electrode configuration, 1V translates into 36 V/cm at the location of neurons. Neuron action potentials were visualized using the voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye, FluoVolt. All experiments were performed in a standard physiological solution containing (in mM): 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg). The exposure system comprised a Siglent SDG1032X waveform generator (Siglent Technologies, Solon, OH), the 'EasywaveX' software, and a pair of tungsten electrodes (100 μm diameter, 140 μm inter-electrode gap) precisely positioned 50 µm above a chosen neuron using a robotic micromanipulator MPC-200 (Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA). Sine waves and modulated sine waves were generated using Excel software, uploaded to the Siglent generator, and exposure parameters (frequency, amplitude, and duration) were set. Exposure was triggered 50 ms after the start of fluorescence time-lapse recording. The applied electric field between electrodes was determined using a finite element method simulation (Sim4Life V5.2, Zurich Med Tech). Exposure duration was kept at 250 ms regardless of the sine wave carrier and modulation frequency.

"Subject ID: 8_2. A sine wave stimulation applied at 2kHz using 4.4V (peak-to-peak) amplitude. Note: this is not the actual amplitude measured on the oscilloscope, which will be somewhat smaller (calibration factors are frequency-dependent and will be reported separately after the calibration is completed). For the employed electrode configuration, 1V translates into 36 V/cm at the location of neurons. Neuron action potentials were visualized using the voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye, FluoVolt. All experiments were performed in a standard physiological solution containing (in mM): 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg). The exposure system comprised a Siglent SDG1032X waveform generator (Siglent Technologies, Solon, OH), the 'EasywaveX' software, and a pair of tungsten electrodes (100 μm diameter, 140 μm inter-electrode gap) precisely positioned 50 µm above a chosen neuron using a robotic micromanipulator MPC-200 (Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA). Sine waves and modulated sine waves were generated using Excel software, uploaded to the Siglent generator, and exposure parameters (frequency, amplitude, and duration) were set. Exposure was triggered 50 ms after the start of fluorescence time-lapse recording. The applied electric field between electrodes was determined using a finite element method simulation (Sim4Life V5.2, Zurich Med Tech). Exposure duration was kept at 250 ms regardless of the sine wave carrier and modulation frequency. Waveform, amplitude, and synchronization were monitored with a TDS3052C oscilloscope (Tektronix, Beaverton, OR). Exposures were synchronized with image acquisitions via a TTL pulse protocol using a Digidata 1440A board and Clampex v. 10.2 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).",

"Subject ID: 8_2. A sine wave stimulation applied at 2kHz using 6V (peak-to-peak) amplitude. Note: this is not the actual amplitude measured on the oscilloscope, which will be somewhat smaller (calibration factors are frequency-dependent and will be reported separately after the calibration is completed). For the employed electrode configuration, 1V translates into 36 V/cm at the location of neurons. Neuron action potentials were visualized using the voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye, FluoVolt. All experiments were performed in a standard physiological solution containing (in mM): 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg). The exposure system comprised a Siglent SDG1032X waveform generator (Siglent Technologies, Solon, OH), the 'EasywaveX' software, and a pair of tungsten electrodes (100 μm diameter, 140 μm inter-electrode gap) precisely positioned 50 µm above a chosen neuron using a robotic micromanipulator MPC-200 (Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA). Sine waves and modulated sine waves were generated using Excel software, uploaded to the Siglent generator, and exposure parameters (frequency, amplitude, and duration) were set. Exposure was triggered 50 ms after the start of fluorescence time-lapse recording. The applied electric field between electrodes was determined using a finite element method simulation (Sim4Life V5.2, Zurich Med Tech). Exposure duration was kept at 250 ms regardless of the sine wave carrier and modulation frequency.

"Subject ID: 9_2. A sine wave stimulation applied at 20Hz using 4.4V (peak-to-peak) amplitude. Note: this is not the actual amplitude measured on the oscilloscope, which will be somewhat smaller (calibration factors are frequency-dependent and will be reported separately after the calibration is completed). For the employed electrode configuration, 1V translates into 36 V/cm at the location of neurons. Neuron action potentials were visualized using the voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye, FluoVolt. All experiments were performed in a standard physiological solution containing (in mM): 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg). The exposure system comprised a Siglent SDG1032X waveform generator (Siglent Technologies, Solon, OH), the 'EasywaveX' software, and a pair of tungsten electrodes (100 μm diameter, 140 μm inter-electrode gap) precisely positioned 50 µm above a chosen neuron using a robotic micromanipulator MPC-200 (Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA). Sine waves and modulated sine waves were generated using Excel software, uploaded to the Siglent generator, and exposure parameters (frequency, amplitude, and duration) were set. Exposure was triggered 50 ms after the start of fluorescence time-lapse recording. The applied electric field between electrodes was determined using a finite element method simulation (Sim4Life V5.2, Zurich Med Tech). Exposure duration was kept at 250 ms regardless of the sine wave carrier and modulation frequency. Waveform, amplitude, and synchronization were monitored with a TDS3052C oscilloscope (Tektronix, Beaverton, OR). Exposures were synchronized with image acquisitions via a TTL pulse protocol using a Digidata 1440A board and Clampex v. 10.2 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).",

"Subject ID: 9_2. A sine wave stimulation applied at 20kHz using 6V (peak-to-peak) amplitude. Note: this is not the actual amplitude measured on the oscilloscope, which will be somewhat smaller (calibration factors are frequency-dependent and will be reported separately after the calibration is completed). For the employed electrode configuration, 1V translates into 36 V/cm at the location of neurons. Neuron action potentials were visualized using the voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye, FluoVolt. All experiments were performed in a standard physiological solution containing (in mM): 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg). The exposure system comprised a Siglent SDG1032X waveform generator (Siglent Technologies, Solon, OH), the 'EasywaveX' software, and a pair of tungsten electrodes (100 μm diameter, 140 μm inter-electrode gap) precisely positioned 50 µm above a chosen neuron using a robotic micromanipulator MPC-200 (Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA). Sine waves and modulated sine waves were generated using Excel software, uploaded to the Siglent generator, and exposure parameters (frequency, amplitude, and duration) were set. Exposure was triggered 50 ms after the start of fluorescence time-lapse recording. The applied electric field between electrodes was determined using a finite element method simulation (Sim4Life V5.2, Zurich Med Tech). Exposure duration was kept at 250 ms regardless of the sine wave carrier and modulation frequency. Waveform, amplitude, and synchronization were monitored with a TDS3052C oscilloscope (Tektronix, Beaverton, OR). Exposures were synchronized with image acquisitions via a TTL pulse protocol using a Digidata 1440A board and Clampex v. 10.2 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).",

Sine waves and modulated sine waves were generated using Excel software, uploaded to the Siglent generator, and exposure parameters (frequency, amplitude, and duration) were set. Exposure was triggered 50 ms after the start of fluorescence time-lapse recording. The applied electric field between electrodes was determined using a finite element method simulation (Sim4Life V5.2, Zurich Med Tech). Exposure duration was kept at 250 ms regardless of the sine wave carrier and modulation frequency. Waveform, amplitude, and synchronization were monitored with a TDS3052C oscilloscope (Tektronix, Beaverton, OR). Exposures were synchronized with image acquisitions via a TTL pulse protocol using a Digidata 1440A board and Clampex v. 10.2 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).",

"Subject ID: 9_2. A spindle (sine wave modulated at 20Hz frequency) stimulation applied at 20kHz using 12V (peak-to-peak) amplitude. Note: this is not the actual amplitude measured on the oscilloscope, which will be somewhat smaller (calibration factors are frequency-dependent and will be reported separately after the calibration is completed). For the employed electrode configuration, 1V translates into 36 V/cm at the location of neurons. Neuron action potentials were visualized using the voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye, FluoVolt. All experiments were performed in a standard physiological solution containing (in mM): 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg).

"Subject ID: 9_2. A sine wave stimulation applied at 2kHz using 2.4V (peak-to-peak) amplitude. Note: this is not the actual amplitude measured on the oscilloscope, which will be somewhat smaller (calibration factors are frequency-dependent and will be reported separately after the calibration is completed). For the employed electrode configuration, 1V translates into 36 V/cm at the location of neurons. Neuron action potentials were visualized using the voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye, FluoVolt. All experiments were performed in a standard physiological solution containing (in mM): 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg). The exposure system comprised a Siglent SDG1032X waveform generator (Siglent Technologies, Solon, OH), the 'EasywaveX' software, and a pair of tungsten electrodes (100 μm diameter, 140 μm inter-electrode gap) precisely positioned 50 µm above a chosen neuron using a robotic micromanipulator MPC-200 (Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA). Sine waves and modulated sine waves were generated using Excel software, uploaded to the Siglent generator, and exposure parameters (frequency, amplitude, and duration) were set. Exposure was triggered 50 ms after the start of fluorescence time-lapse recording. The applied electric field between electrodes was determined using a finite element method simulation (Sim4Life V5.2, Zurich Med Tech).

"Subject ID: 9_2. A sine wave stimulation applied at 2kHz using 4V (peak-to-peak) amplitude. Note: this is not the actual amplitude measured on the oscilloscope, which will be somewhat smaller (calibration factors are frequency-dependent and will be reported separately after the calibration is completed). For the employed electrode configuration, 1V translates into 36 V/cm at the location of neurons. Neuron action potentials were visualized using the voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye, FluoVolt. All experiments were performed in a standard physiological solution containing (in mM): 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg). The exposure system comprised a Siglent SDG1032X waveform generator (Siglent Technologies, Solon, OH), the 'EasywaveX' software, and a pair of tungsten electrodes (100 μm diameter, 140 μm inter-electrode gap) precisely positioned 50 µm above a chosen neuron using a robotic micromanipulator MPC-200 (Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA). Sine waves and modulated sine waves were generated using Excel software, uploaded to the Siglent generator, and exposure parameters (frequency, amplitude, and duration) were set. Exposure was triggered 50 ms after the start of fluorescence time-lapse recording. The applied electric field between electrodes was determined using a finite element method simulation (Sim4Life V5.2, Zurich Med Tech). Exposure duration was kept at 250 ms regardless of the sine wave carrier and modulation frequency. Waveform, amplitude, and synchronization were monitored with a TDS3052C oscilloscope (Tektronix, Beaverton, OR). Exposures were synchronized with image acquisitions via a TTL pulse protocol using a Digidata 1440A board and Clampex v. 10.2 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).",

"Subject ID: 9_2. A spindle (sine wave modulated at 20Hz frequency) stimulation applied at 2kHz using 2.6V (peak-to-peak) amplitude. Note: this is not the actual amplitude measured on the oscilloscope, which will be somewhat smaller (calibration factors are frequency-dependent and will be reported separately after the calibration is completed). For the employed electrode configuration, 1V translates into 36 V/cm at the location of neurons. Neuron action potentials were visualized using the voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye, FluoVolt. All experiments were performed in a standard physiological solution containing (in mM): 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.3, 290-300 mOsm/kg). The exposure system comprised a Siglent SDG1032X waveform generator (Siglent Technologies, Solon, OH), the 'EasywaveX' software, and a pair of tungsten electrodes (100 μm diameter, 140 μm inter-electrode gap) precisely positioned 50 µm above a chosen neuron using a robotic micromanipulator MPC-200 (Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA). Sine waves and modulated sine waves were generated using Excel software, uploaded to the Siglent generator, and exposure parameters (frequency, amplitude, and duration) were set. Exposure was triggered 50 ms after the start of fluorescence time-lapse recording. The applied electric field between electrodes was determined using a finite element method simulation (Sim4Life V5.2, Zurich Med Tech). Exposure duration was kept at 250 ms regardless of the sine wave carrier and modulation frequency. Waveform, amplitude, and synchronization were monitored with a TDS3052C oscilloscope (Tektronix, Beaverton, OR). Exposures were synchronized with image acquisitions via a TTL pulse protocol using a Digidata 1440A board and Clampex v. 10.2 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).",
